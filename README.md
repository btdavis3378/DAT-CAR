# DATCAR

### Data Accumulation Through a Car Altering Remote
<br/>

### Project Objective
Collection and Visualization of Environmental Data with DAT CAR Rover

### Software Used
1. Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with Raspbian
2. Python3
3. HTML
4. JavaScript
5. Flask
6. ownCloud
7. Apache
8. PhP

### Purpose
This was a project done in my Networks course at Florida Gulf Coast University during Fall 2019. After the project was finished, the next semester, Spring 2020, the project assignment was to maintain/improve the project.

### Current Functionality
DAT CAR is currently able to set up a webserver with Flask to allow a user to control the rover from a computer's web browser. Addtionally, DAT CAR is equipped with a Pi Camera, to allow the user to see where it is going. With Python, the rover can move forwards, backwards, left, and right. DAT CAR is able to collect environment data such as:  distance of an object in front of it, temperature, and humidity of the surrounding area.

### Plans for the Spring 2020 semester
It was desired that a user be able to access the collected environmental data, so cloud implementation is being worked on. The cloud tool that is being utilized is ownCloud.
Some of the sub-objectives include:
1. Improve the current database by integrating an SQL or LINQ database
2. Improve the hull integrity of DAT CAR
3. Increase the stability of the camera mount
4. Increase the battery life of the motor module
5. Save images to ownCloud

### Documentation
I will be adding more documentation to the code as the journey with this project continues.
The .doc file is the report and documentation for this project
